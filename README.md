# Web-Mapping-Assignment
This is the GitHub repo for the Web Mapping Assignment



As this is the optional hand in, I will provide just a prototype of my project. 

In our last meeting I mentioned that I want to do a temperature based map of Austria, and prove how different parts of the environment influence temperature. However, this proved to be a very challenging task for a beginnner.
I decided to swith it up for something less difficult, Mozart attraction points in Salzburg. Keep in mind that this is only a prototype and I still need to add a few locations. 
I just want to make sure that this idea is fine for you and I also want to verify if the 2 required interactive features are enough: zoom in when you click a location and the pop-up with the name, a short description and an image 
of the specific attraction. Also, is the layer controll tab good enough?

I still need to find a better looking map and some better icons for each specific location for the final hand-in on the 26th of June.
